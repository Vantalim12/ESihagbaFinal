# eSihagBa Core Vision

When working on eSihagBa, align with this core functionality:

## Primary Flow
1. **One wallet per barangay** – Each barangay has a unique wallet address (their budget account)
2. **LGU Super Admin allocates** – LGU sends/assigns budget to each barangay for a time period (e.g., quarterly)
3. **Transparent spending** – Each barangay sees their allocation, spending, and remaining balance; citizens can verify on-chain

## Roles
- **LGU Super Admin**: Create barangay wallets, allocate budgets per period, oversee all barangays
- **Barangay Admin**: Manage own barangay wallet, record spending
- **Auditor**: Read-only compliance access
- **Citizen**: Public transparency view (no auth)

## Key Concepts
- Barangay = Entity with primary wallet
- BudgetAllocation = LGU → Barangay for period X
- Transaction = Spending from barangay wallet, linked to allocation/period

See `ARCHITECTURE_AND_VISION.md` for full design, architecture review, and implementation phases (Phase 0–7).
